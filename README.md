Within terminal, install expo-cli. Make sure to install NodeJs first!

```
npm i expo-cli
```

Next, download Android Studio and set up an android emulator.

To start front-end, open up android studio emulator first and then enter into terminal: 

```
expo start
```

This will open up a local host connection. On terminal, it should give you a localhost url

```
Ex: https://localhost:19002
```

Navigate to "localhost" on web browser and on the left side, execute 


```
"Run on Android device/emulator". 
```
this should open up the project on emulator.
